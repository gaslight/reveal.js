# Gaslight's reveal.js fork

Featuring an awesome Gaslight theme powered by [Sass], [Compass] and [Guard].
Use this as a starting point for your next presentation. Might not make much
sense unless you're a Gaslighter or a huge fan, though.

## Setup

Want to make changes to the Sass? Just follow these steps:

1. `git clone git://github.com/gaslight/reveal.js.git`
1. `cd reveal.js`
1. `script/bootstrap`
1. `foreman start`

That's it! You're ready to edit some Sass. It'll compile in to the css/ dir so
you can just reload the page to see your changes.
